# ggchicklet Source Code
The [ggchicklet library](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggchicklet) in R has been made unavailable for the newer versions of R. This code provides the code to be able to keep using the ggchicklet features.

If you have previously tried to install and use the `ggchicklet` library in R and faced this issue: 

```
> install.packages("ggchicklet", repos = "https://cinc.rud.is")
Warning in install.packages :
  unable to access index for repository https://cinc.rud.is/src/contrib:
  cannot open URL 'https://cinc.rud.is/src/contrib/PACKAGES'
Warning in install.packages :
  package ‘ggchicklet’ is not available for this version of R
```

please feel free to use my version of the code I retrieved from the library. Saving this as a separate source code file and pulling them into the code you need will help you to be able to draw bar/column charts with curved corners and generate beautiful visualizations!

## Code of Conduct
Please keep in mind that this code originally belongs to the authors of the original [ggchicklet library](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggchicklet). This code was retrieved from their repository and made usable for the public as the library no longer works with the newer versions of R.
